        "\n",
        "**Objective:** In this lab, you will create a Java program to manipulate student scores. You will implement a class called `TestFile` with methods to read student scores from a file, calculate the total score for a student, retrieve edited student IDs, and create a new file with edited scores.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "1. Create a Java class called `TestFile`.\n",
        "2. Implement the `read_scores` method that reads student scores from a file and stores them in a `HashMap`. The file should contain lines with student IDs and quiz scores, separated by commas.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Task 2: Implement `getTotalScore` Method**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Implement the `getTotalScore` method that takes a student ID as input and returns the total score for that student. It should use the `HashMap` from Task 1.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Task 3: Implement `getEditedStudentID` Method**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Implement the `getEditedStudentID` method that reads a file containing edited student scores. It should return a `HashSet` of unique student IDs found in the edited file.\n",

        "**Task 4: Implement `createNewEditedScore` Method**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Implement the `createNewEditedScore` method that reads both the original student scores and the edited scores files. It updates the original scores with the edited scores and writes the updated scores to a new file.\n",
