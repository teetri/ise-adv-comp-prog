        "**Objectives:**\n",
        "- Understand the Singleton design pattern.\n",
        "- Implement a Singleton class, `FileReaderSingleton`, for reading lines from a file.\n",
        "- Manage file access, opening, and closing within the Singleton class.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Instructions:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Create a new Java class called `FileReaderSingleton`. This class will implement the Singleton pattern for file access.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Define the following private attributes and methods within the `FileReaderSingleton` class:\n",
        "\n",
        "   - `private static FileReaderSingleton instance`: A static instance of the class.\n",
        "   - `private BufferedReader reader`: A `BufferedReader` for reading lines from the file.\n",
        "   - `private void openFile()`: A method that opens the file, \"data.txt,\" and initializes the `reader`. Handle any `FileNotFoundException` that may occur.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. In the `FileReaderSingleton` class, implement a private constructor to prevent direct instantiation. In this constructor, call the `openFile()` method to open the file.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Implement a public static method, `getInstance()`, that returns the Singleton instance. This method should follow the Singleton pattern, ensuring there is only one instance of the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Implement a public method, `readLineFromFile()`, which reads a line from the file and returns it as a string. This method should handle exceptions related to file access, such as `IOException`.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Implement a public method, `closeFile()`, which closes the file. Handle any `IOException` that may occur during the file closing.\n",
